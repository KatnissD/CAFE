Before using, please make sure that python 3.X has been installed on your computer. When using, download the repository to the local.

CAFE is mainly divided into two parts.The first part is used to calculate the mCAI value, and the second part is used to optimize the gene sequence to increase the amount of gene expression.

**PART1: calculate mCAI value**

The main script for calculating CAI is mCAI_comp.py, the parameter options of the script are as follows:
